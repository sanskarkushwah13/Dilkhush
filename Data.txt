The perfectionists-7X Wedding Planners. They conceptualised and managed everything at a grand level for our wedding. We had the vision of a royal wedding and Rajat ji and team understood every requirement easily. I would say they are the finest people in the wedding industry, who have a taste towards executing royal weddings seamlessly. Not only this, they also did everything keeping in mind the budget that was allocated to them. Nothing could have been better! Our invitations, catering, decor and photographer every choice was awesome along with a great level of micro management.

Nidhi and Sopan Testimony for 7X Wedding Planners
NIDHI + SOPAN
7x Events took care of every single aspect that I dreaded (decor, flowers, prop rental etc.). I had a rough idea in my mind and they would take it away and refine it until it became an exquisite detail. THAT takes talent as well as a strong commitment and dedication to a job well done! Rajat sir or devang sir helped with every vendor meeting that I needed help with and took over when they knew I was exhausted and/or just needed them to step in and make the decisions on my behalf.

Ours was an intercaste wedding and to execute two types of weddings on the same day was actually a task.

It was truly the best day of our lives and we will treasure all the memories. This wedding was not possible without you guys.

Each member of the team 7X worked equally well which made all the events so successful. It is the result of their hard work and team effort. Everything was executed with such e egance, care, and attention to every detail there was nothing over looked.

Congratulations on running such a successful wedding of Rishi & Neha. Everything went perfect. It was a blessing to be able to spend time with family and friends before and during the ceremony. All happened because of 7x Wedding Planners best part was coordination and hospitality of the team. They helped us with some last minute fines and even added thoughtful extra touches. Their special attention to every detail makes them best in their class. We would highly recommend them to any couple planning their wedding.

I hired 7X for my wedding because I honestly had no idea where to begin.

It was great to have 7x as our event managements company, being in different cities I was sceptical About US how efficient the coordination would be, but Rajatji and Devang ji made the coordination so comfortable that the difference did not matter.

After meeting with Rajat and his team we knew they were the perfect match for us. Big thanks to you and your team for the kind of planning done and completing each part so brilliantly.
